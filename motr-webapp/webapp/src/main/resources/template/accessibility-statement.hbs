        <p>This service is run by the Driver & Vehicle Standards Agency. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service.
        For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
        <ul class="list-bullet govuk-!-margin-bottom-5 govuk-!-margin-left-5">
            <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
            <li>get from the start of the service to the end using just a keyboard</li>
            <li>get from the start of the service to the end using speech recognition software</li>
            <li>listen to the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We’ve also made the text in the service as simple as possible to understand.</p>
